Note on MIT Technology Review: their AI topic page (https://www.technologyreview.com/topic/artificial-intelligence/) blocks most automated requests; if you need that outlet, plan on proxying through an RSS service or paid API rather than raw scraping.

With these URLs in place you can configure your crawlers or RSS fetchers for daily or weekly polling and be confident you’re hitting the primary release points, the fastest community amplifiers, and the most reliable news round-ups for AI and LLM developments.
