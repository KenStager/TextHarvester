## Implementation Approach

### Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**
   - Each intelligence feature should be isolated as a separate module
   - Features should be independently deployable and testable
   - Clear interfaces between components

2. **Progressive Complexity**
   - Start with foundational capabilities
   - Add complexity incrementally
   - Ensure each stage provides value

3. **Domain Adaptability**
   - Architecture should support multiple domains
   - Domain-specific components should follow a common pattern
   - Clear separation between general and domain-specific code

4. **Resource Awareness**
   - Intelligence features should be resource-efficient
   - Heavy processing should be optional
   - Configurable resource limits for different environments

### Development Strategy

1. **Pipeline-First Development**
   - Develop base pipelines for new features first
   - Add domain-specific implementations once base is stable
   - Create generic interfaces for common patterns

2. **Evaluation Focus**
   - Establish clear evaluation metrics for each feature
   - Implement evaluation as part of development
   - Test with diverse content before deployment

3. **Integration Patterns**
   - Define standard patterns for integrating new intelligence features
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Create clear documentation for integration points

4. **Incremental Rollout**
   - Release features incrementally
   - Start with opt-in alpha/beta access
   - Gather feedback before general availability

### Technical Requirements

Each intelligence feature should meet the following technical requirements:

1. **Performance**
   - Minimal impact on scraping performance
   - Efficient resource usage
   - Support for batch processing where appropriate

2. **Reliability**
   - Graceful degradation on failure
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - No negative impact on core functionality

3. **Configurability**
   - User-configurable parameters
   - Enable/disable at granular levels
   - Domain-specific configuration options

4. **Testability**
